# Retos picoCTF

# Level GDB baby step 1

## Objetivo
Can you figure out what is in the eax register at the end of the main function? Put your answer in the picoCTF flag format: picoCTF{n} where n is the contents of the eax register in the decimal number base. If the answer was 0x11 your flag would be picoCTF{17}.
Disassemble this.
